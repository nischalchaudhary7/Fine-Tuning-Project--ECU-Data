2025-02-22 11:53:55,872 - DeepSeek API Response: Okay, the user is asking about the tuition cost at East Central University (ECU) in Ada, Oklahoma. Let me start by recalling what I know about ECU's tuition. I remember that tuition can vary based on whether the student is in-state or out-of-state. Also, there might be different rates for undergraduate and graduate programs. 

First, I should check if ECU's website has the most up-to-date information. Since I can't browse the internet, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge up to 2023. Let me think: for public universities in Oklahoma, in-state tuition is generally lower. Maybe around $7,000 to $8,000 per year for undergraduates? But I need to be precise. Wait, I recall that ECU's tuition is calculated per credit hour. So, multiplying by the number of credit hours per semester would give the total.

Typically, full-time students take 12-18 credit hours per semester. Let's say the in

2025-02-22 12:07:22,805 - DeepSeek API Response: Okay, the user is asking where ECU is located. Let me start by recalling that ECU stands for East Central University. I know it's a university in Oklahoma, but I need to confirm the exact city.

Wait, I think ECU is in Ada, Oklahoma. Let me make sure. Yes, East Central University is located in Ada, Oklahoma. Ada is a city in the southern part of the state. Should I mention the state abbreviation as OK or Oklahoma? Probably spell it out for clarity since the user might not be familiar with state abbreviations.

Also, maybe add a bit more context. Ada is the county seat of Pontotoc County. Including that could be helpful. Let me check if there's any other relevant information. The university was founded in 1909, but the user didn't ask about the history, just the location. So stick to the location details.

Wait, the user is using "ECU" which could be confused with other universities, like East Carolina University, which is also abbreviated as ECU. But since the user specified East Central University in the initial prompt, I should focus on that. But maybe clarify in the answer to avoid confusion, just in case.

So the answer should be: East Central University (ECU) is located in Ada, Oklahoma, USA. Ada is the county seat of Pontotoc County in the southern part of the state. That's concise and provides the necessary information. Maybe mention the state's name in full to avoid ambiguity with other states that have similar abbreviations. Also, confirming the country (USA) might be helpful for international users.
East Central University (ECU) is located in **Ada, Oklahoma, USA**. Ada serves as the county seat of Pontotoc County and is situated in the southern part of Oklahoma.

While it may be a difficult time for students as they find their way and decide on career paths, we realize that it may also be very hard on you. We see you and we hear you and we are here to help make the transition easier.",

Our hope is to bridge the gap between you and the ECU community, share our resources and help your student become the next East Central University graduate.",

A healthy relationship between students and loved ones leads to a positive experience at ECU, so it is our goal to assist parents in their efforts to gather any information that enables them to help their student succeed. Your support now will have a lasting impact on your student\u2019s college journey.",

This mission is accomplished by providing educational, social, and cultural campus-wide programming through East Central University's Campus Activities Board, and by providing direct advisement for the governing bodies of ECU\u2019s five chapters of (inter)national Greek-letter organizations.\n\u00a0\nThe Office of Campus Involvement also provides services, leadership development resources, and recognition programs for 65 student organizations. Student Organizations connect students with a stronger sense of community, develop group building and leadership skills, and serve as an outlet for self-expression and sharing of talents. The Office provides assistance with student organization recognition, organization recruitment and retention, publicizing on campus, and event planning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nEnhance your education at ECU by becoming involved.\u00a0Please view our Student Organizations Directory to browse the many student organizations or to search for a specific group.

Many fundraising activities require prior University approval, particularly for sale and solicitation activity. State law prohibits some activities, such as lotteries and raffles. You should clear your fundraising request by completing a Request to a Hold a Fundraiser form in the Office of Campus Involvement as a first step. All sales and transactions must be conducted by currently enrolled students of the organizations or the advisor.

Oftentimes the letters are chosen to represent an organization that reflects the deeper meaning and core values of the organization.\n\u00a0Then what's the big deal?\nImagine knowing things less than 1% of the population knows. Consider being connected to Fortune 500 executives, celebrities, National Champions, Presidents and congress men and women all across the country, all of which, call you brother or sister. Greeks are determined to make an impact on the world. So, when you are at a community service event or raising money for charity, when you are playing on an intramural team or attending a leadership conference; you are developing the skills and potential within yourself to change the world.",

In addition to academic performance, measured primarily by the Grade Point Average, the Admissions Committee considers other factors that contribute to the development of a professional. Formal work experience in the human services, particularly in settings that serve public social services clients, is important. Other factors considered include: volunteer experience in the human services; life experiences and opportunities for personal growth, leadership, communication and interpersonal relationship skills; problem solving ability; the ability to work with and respect persons from diverse backgrounds; health and stamina; and motivation for graduate work and a career in administration or counseling.",

To receive an \u201cI\u201d grade, the student should have satisfactorily completed a substantial portion of the required coursework for the semester. \u201cI\u201d grades must be changed by the instructor within one (1) year from the end of the semester in which the \u201cI\u201d was assigned or they will remain as a permanent \u201cI\u201d and not contribute to the student\u2019s GPA.",

Departmental courses in which a passing grade is made may not be repeated. Courses in which a lower grade is made may be repeated only with an advisor and/or departmental approval. The last grade is counted with reference to graduation requirements. No additional credit is allowed for a repeated course. Students accumulating more than six (6) semester hours of \u201cC\u201d or lower in courses will have their admission to the program reviewed. Credit with grades of \u201cD\u201d will not satisfy specific degree requirements. After appropriate review and discussion with the student, the Department may recommend to the Graduate Dean the termination of student\u2019s admission to the degree program, place the student on departmental probation with stated criteria for reinstatement, and/or recommend remedial action which the student must complete in order to return to good standing.

As a Registered Nurse who earned her degree while raising two children and helping her husband get his new business off the ground, Sue understood the importance of community and support from others. She also believed that education can change lives. Access to an education and to a career in nursing should not be foreclosed simply because a person cannot afford it. Clarehouse and the Holloway family are committed to supporting those who have a dream of becoming a caregiver, particularly in this time of unprecedented need for nurses and other healthcare professionals.",

        "paragraphs": [
            "This decade is an exciting time for students looking into careers as home healthcare nurses. By 2030, 20% of Americans are projected to be older than 65 thanks to the aging of the Baby Boomer generation. This population change will naturally increase the demand for all forms of nursing, including home healthcare nursing. Between 2019-2029, employment of Licensed Practical Nurse (LPNs) is projected to increase by 9%, and employment of Registered Nurse (RNs) is projected to increase by 7%. In contrast, the average projected increase for all occupations is just 4%.",
            "For those interested in a career as a home healthcare nurse, this changing job market means ample opportunities and a bright future. The benefits of home healthcare are being increasingly recognized and utilized by society at large, and insurance companies and government agencies are changing their policies to reflect the shift, making the demand and accessibility of home healthcare even greater.",
            "If you are interested in this career path and want to learn more, this guide is for you. Read on to find in-depth information on what services home healthcare nurses provide, education and training requirements, how to find a job, and more.",
            "TABLE OF CONTENTS",
            "Home healthcare nurses have the same core training and skills as other licensed nurses (RNs and LPNs), but they choose to apply their skills outside of hospitals. They typically work for home care agencies, and their patients are often seniors who are disabled, are adjusting to new diagnoses, or are recovering from an operation or illness.",
            "The different members of a home care team typically visit the patient alone and they perform different roles, but they have the same basic goals of improving patient health and preventing the need for hospitalization. To truly understand the home health nurse\u2019s role, you need to compare and contrast that role with a few other key home care positions.",
            "In many cases, home care nurses will have regular contact with a patient\u2019s family caregiver, often a spouse. Family caregivers are frequently unpaid for their labor, and they may have little training and be very stressed by their roles. If a caregiver (family or otherwise) is paid, they are accountable to the family and/or patient plus any agency that\u2019s involved. The term caregiver can be vague, so another word or phrase may also refer to the same basic role.",
            "Regardless, people who are called caregivers typically provide companionship and assist the patient with numerous Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) like dressing, using the restroom, eating, and bathing. They typically also help with \u201cInstrumental\u201d ADLs related to managing the household and providing transportation. They may be authorized to make medical decisions on behalf of the patient. This role has a lot of overlap with direct care roles (below), but there are distinctions.",
            "Home health nurses may have no authority over a caregiver, but they do have the responsibility to keep the caregiver informed on the patient\u2019s health. Nurses often spend time providing family caregivers and patients with education and hands-on training. It\u2019s good to keep in mind that every situation is different, however. Some of your patients will have no designated caregiver, and some will have multiple part-time caregivers and/or a combination of paid and unpaid caregivers.",
            "Home health nurses, especially RNs, often have a supervisory relationship to direct care workers. You may be unfamiliar with the term direct care workers but recognize the two main subtypes, Home Health Aide (HHA) and Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA). CNAs and HHAs typically complete similar 75 hours of required training, but a CNA has a higher level of medical training than an HHA. CNAs and HHA perform many of the same ADL tasks that caregivers do, so they help prevent the caregiver from becoming burned out. They may also fully take over tasks that have become too difficult for the caregiver.",
            "A CNA additionally helps with things like medication management, taking vital signs, updating medical records, and providing limited wound care. Depending on the state, an HHA may be permitted to do some of the same tasks. As a nurse, you will have more training than the HHAs and CNAs that you supervise, but they often have more face-to-face time with the patient. Direct care workers are often the first people to speak up about a problem, and supervising nurses respond by providing additional assessments and expertise.",
            "The responsibilities of a home health nurse are diverse, and the pacing and variety of tasks within a workday will vary considerably. That\u2019s part of the appeal of home health work for many nurses \u2013 the position is inherently flexible. You may like the fact that its challenges are different from the challenges presented in hospitals.",
            "Key Tasks and Skills in Home Healthcare Nursing:",
            "Starting the Day and Understanding Scheduling",
            "As a home health nurse, you would probably start your day by hopping in your car which should be stocked with medical and office supplies. Home health nurses won\u2019t necessarily check into a central work location daily \u2013 they\u2019re more likely to just go straight to their first patient\u2019s home. Nurses often contact their patients about appointments the night before. Since you\u2019ll be seeing about 6 patients in a day, you might use specialized scheduling software to minimize your time on the road. The exact amount of time you spend with patients will be determined by the purpose of the visit and the policies of the agency and/or the involved insurance company.",
            "Visiting Patients in Their Homes",
            "Virtually all patient visits will involve taking vitals and chatting with the patient and/or family. You\u2019ll often be following up on needs that were brought to your attention by someone else. Your plans for the visit may change dramatically if you arrive and see an urgent, unmet need. On any given day, you might draw blood for lab tests, administer an intravenous drug, speak with a patient about medications or mental health, teach a caregiver a new skill, replace a catheter, dress a wound, or perform any number of other skilled tasks. You\u2019re also likely to perform some tasks that are considered ADLs. It\u2019s often true that such tasks could be done by someone less skilled, but by taking part in them, you gain insight into how the patient is doing.",
            "Keeping Records, Coordinating Care, and Advocating for the Patient",
            "All home healthcare nurses will need to efficiently complete a significant amount of work that is not really patient-facing at all. You\u2019ll do this work throughout the day, keeping neat records. If you\u2019re an LPN, you\u2019ll likely be in touch with a supervising RN (though the RN is not physically present). If you\u2019re an RN then you\u2019ll be a contact person for LPNs and CNAs",
            "RNs often communicate with patients\u2019 primary physicians, social workers, and specialists. The frequency and method of communication varies, but if you\u2019re an RN, then you are working hard to coordinate care. When multiple chronic conditions and doctors are involved, nurses may catch contradictions in what\u2019s been recommended by different parties. Advocating for the patient in such situations is part and parcel of being a skilled nurse. In urgent situations, RNs get in touch with emergency services or expedite the patient\u2019s admission to a facility that can best handle the current need.",
            "Home healthcare nurses are either Registered Nurses (RNs) or Licenced Practical Nurses (LPNs)*, and they do not typically need to have any additional certifications. However, some training programs may provide special opportunities to focus on home healthcare skills. Home health agencies also often want you to have 1-2 years of work experience in a hospital or other setting before they hire you, but this will vary. Below you can explore the differences between training to be an LPN and an RN.",
            "*Residents of California and Texas should note that LPNs are called Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs) in their states.",
            "An LPN has trained vocationally for about 1 year and has passed the NCLEX-PN exam. LPNs work directly with patients, providing skilled nursing help, but they are prohibited from doing some tasks that RNs can do. They typically report to other on-staff RNs. In some situations, CNAs may report to LPNs.",
            "An RN has trained in higher education for 2-4 years and has passed the NCLEX-RN exam. RNs work directly with patients, performing the full range of skilled nursing tasks. However, RNs usually also provide supervision to LPNs and CNAs, and they may delegate tasks as needed.",
            "If you want to be a home health nurse, choosing between the RN and LPN training pathways may be very difficult for you. The difference between time commitments and costs can make aiming to become an LPN more appealing in the short term, but the earning potential for RNs, particularly those with BSNs, is much higher. Ultimately, there\u2019s no one right answer. As you explore your options, you should keep in mind that there are also \u201cbridge\u201d programs designed to help LPNs transition to careers as RNs. Below you can see how much different training pathways tend to cost.",
            "Private: Average of $19,702",
            "Private: Average of $22,035",
            "The net costs for different schools are derived from complex calculations that factor in things like room and board (not in all cases), financial aid, tuition, fees, and more. Visit the U.S. Department of Education College Affordability and Transparency List to see how individual schools compare and to learn more about how net costs are calculated. Note that the Department of Education provided no net average for LPN programs, so we have listed the full range. LPN programs tend to be inexpensive, despite some high-cost outliers.",
            "Other Costs to Consider",
            "In addition to the net costs in the table above, you may face other costs that are difficult to calculate. You\u2019ll need to buy numerous textbooks and supplies, including scrubs. You\u2019ll probably be affected by lost wages since participating full-time in both work and school/unpaid training hours won\u2019t be possible. For some, going to school may necessitate paying for extra childcare, buying a new computer or car, moving, taking on a student loan, or making other changes that will be costly. When you finish your formal education, you\u2019ll also need to pay to take an exam called the NCLEX-PN or NCLEX-RN.",
            "Getting into a career in home health nursing will require a lot of hard work, but for the right person, it can be very rewarding in both practical and intangible ways. Below you can explore compensation, and you can also consider some obstacles so that you\u2019re fully prepared for challenges you may face.",
            "The median annual earnings of a home healthcare LPN is about $48,000 yearly and for home healthcare RNs that median income jumps to about $66,000. In contrast, a CNA working in the home care setting may make only about $28,600 annually. Though paying for the required schooling may be difficult, the long-term financial benefits of training to be a home healthcare nurse are clear.",
            "It\u2019s worth noting that currently, median compensation for home health nurses is lower than compensation in hospitals (the difference may be about $5,000 per year in some cases), but that may change soon. Industry insiders are pushing for equal pay. As seniors favor home care more and more, the work is only likely to be valued more highly. Moreover, some unique, emerging positions in the home health nurse market (like \u201con-demand\u201d nursing positions) actually pay nurses better wages and provide payments faster than is average for hospital nurses.",
            "The following questions are designed to alert you to potential career obstacles. These questions may be useful prompts to guide further research or conversations.",
            "While still in training, try to develop good connections with teaching staff, practicing nurses, and your fellow students. Talking about career development with those who have been there can be invaluable. Any experienced nurses that you know might be able to provide insights you just can\u2019t get from a textbook. They may also be able to advise you regarding up-to-date hiring practices.",
            "Even peers who are as new to nursing as you are may be able to help you by sharing their job hunting victories and mistakes. Moreover, peers can also help you with referrals later on. According to Glassdoor, an employee referral can increase your odds of landing a job by up to 6.6%, yet including referrals on applications is relatively uncommon.",
            "As you near completion of your schooling, it\u2019s a good idea to research employment trends for nurses in your area. One way to start is to use this Medicare.gov search tool to look up home health services in your zip code. This can give you some information on top local employers. Other options for learning more include local news websites, state or county employment websites, and advisors at your school.",
            "The good news for those interested in home health nursing is that many nurses aspire to and apply only to highly-competitive hospital jobs. This means you may find that there\u2019s an urgent need for home health staffing in your area. However, home health agencies frequently require 1-2 years of prior work experience in nursing. Some will just require/prefer a year of experience in homecare of any kind, not necessarily nursing. If that\u2019s the case, prior experience as a CNA or other direct care worker will be invaluable.",
            "If your chances of landing a home health nursing position right away are low, then consider an entry-level position elsewhere. Even if you don\u2019t prefer it, it will give you the experience that you need in order to later do the job you really want. If the job market for nurses in your area is highly competitive, you may even wish to consider a temporary location change.",
            "You will see many job postings for home health nurses on general-purpose job sites, but you will probably find that nursing-specific search tools will be more useful. Many such sites will often have free resources with tips for resume writing, interviewing, and more. Below we\u2019ve provided suggestions for top job search tools for nurses.",
            "A Word on Job Postings that Indicate a Nursing Specialization",
            "Many job postings that you see will refer to specializations such as palliative care, hospice, mental health, or even specific chronic conditions. Ultimately, for many of these postings, you will not need additional certification in the specialty mentioned. The specialization may be included in the title just to let you know what the focus of the work is. However, read the posting carefully to make sure that you are qualified or to learn if you can take steps to become qualified.",
            "The following resources are a great place to start if you\u2019d like to dig deeper into becoming a home health nurse. A few of the items below address topics that all prospective RNs and LPNs will find useful regardless of specialty, while others specifically address home healthcare nursing topics.",
            "Is home healthcare nursing a common career choice for men?",
            "No, home healthcare nursing is not a common career choice for men at this time \u2013 this workforce is still overwhelmingly female. However, men do seem to be choosing nursing more than they used to. According to a 2015 NYU study, the percentage of males in nursing grew from 8.8% to 13.6% between 2005 and 2015. Men who choose this rewarding career path may face some social stigma, but the trend is towards better options for men in healthcare.",
            "Can home health nurses pursue education beyond a bachelor\u2019s degree?",
            "Yes, home health nurses may pursue higher levels of education. For example, you can study and train to become a Nurse Practitioner. Nurse Practitioners have graduate degrees and earn much higher salaries than RNs and LPNs. The practicality of pursuing certification as a Nurse Practitioner for the purpose of advancing in home health nursing will vary. Some Nurse Practitioners do indeed visit patients in their homes, but such positions may be relatively hard to find at this time.",
            "How can home healthcare nurses stay healthy and avoid burnout?",
            "To avoid burnout, nurses need to pay special attention to their safety and mental and physical health. Nursing, in general, is a stress-filled profession, and home health nurses in particular face challenges related to commuting, working alone, and entering uncontrolled home environments. Home nurses may benefit from digging into the resources provided by the Healthy Nurses Healthy Nations Grand Challenge.",
            "Can a CNA be a home healthcare nurse?",
            "CNAs are nursing assistants, and cannot fill the same role that a home health RN or LPN fills. However, becoming a CNA is the first step toward a full nursing career for many people. CNA work can give you a feel for what interacting with patients is like. It can also help you get your foot in the door with an employer who may later hire you as a nurse if you continue your education.",
            "Which states have the most home healthcare and home health nursing jobs?",
            "Texas, California, Nevada, Florida, and Michigan are the states with the most home healthcare jobs (as measured by the number of home healthcare providers per county). Sometimes finding information on exactly how many home healthcare nurses are in a state is difficult, but general home healthcare trends are a good indication of how many home healthcare nursing jobs there are. In general, areas with unusually high percentages of seniors will provide the most job opportunities.",

If the applicant has not satisfied these requirements at the post-secondary level, the applicant's high school transcript may be used to ensure that all basic academic requirements have been met (see Freshman Admissions for eligibility).

Students who need an ACCUPLACER test for course placement can also take the test at Tiger Enrollment Day. Beginning freshmen will receive sign-up information through the e-mail used on the ECU application.",

Beginning freshmen who do not have a 19 or higher in English and Reading on the ACT, and who also do not have a 3.0 high school GPA or \u201cB\u201d or higher in senior high school English have the option to either enroll in zero-level courses or successfully complete the ACCUPLACER exam in those subject areas. (A score of 510 in a subject area on the SAT is equivalent to a score of 19 in an ACT subject area).",
            "We offer one ACCUPLACER testing session to all students free of charge, so we encourage students to test for any areas where they do not meet the ACT criteria during that testing session. Students can retake the ACCUPLACER one time, at least 30 days after the first test attempt, for a $15 retest fee (paid to the ECU Bursar). There is a maximum of two testing sessions per student. Please contact us at 580-559-5696 to schedule the ACCUPLACER exam.",
            "Note: The ACCUPLACER is the name of the testing software and not the name of the individual test. The Academic Success Center offers all of the ACCUPLACER tests needed for course placement at ECU, and testing is provided for this purpose only. ACCUPLACER scores are not sent to or received from other institutions, as many schools use different types of ACCUPLACER tests to determine placement.",

This is perhaps the most basic and flexible of estate planning instruments.",
            "Gifts of Insurance\nBy assigning ownership to the Foundation or making the Foundation the beneficiary of a life insurance policy that is no longer needed for its original purpose (such as sheltering children\u2019s education), a donor can make a substantial gift at a low cost and take an immediate income tax deduction for the value of the policy. A donor then can contribute an amount equal to the policy\u2019s premiums to the Foundation and deduct that gift as a charitable contribution. Proceeds of the policy will pass to the Foundation free of estate taxes.",

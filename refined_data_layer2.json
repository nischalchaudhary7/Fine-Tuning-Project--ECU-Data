            "What's Greek life all about?\nEssentially, Greek life can provide you with opportunities to further your career, increase your personal and professional network, and help you develop inter- and intrapersonal skills all while hanging out with like-minded men and women that feel like family.\u00a0\nSo what's with the letters?\nThe tradition of using Greek letters to name organizations on college campuses has been around for over 200 years; since 1776. Oftentimes the letters are chosen to represent an organization that reflects the deeper meaning and core values of the organization.\n\u00a0Then what's the big deal?\nImagine knowing things less than 1% of the population knows. Consider being connected to Fortune 500 executives, celebrities, National Champions, Presidents and congress men and women all across the country, all of which, call you brother or sister. Greeks are determined to make an impact on the world. So, when you are at a community service event or raising money for charity, when you are playing on an intramural team or attending a leadership conference; you are developing the skills and potential within yourself to change the world.",

We see you and we hear you and we are here to help make the transition easier.",

Our hope is to bridge the gap between you and the ECU community, share our resources and help your student become the next East Central University graduate.",

A healthy relationship between students and loved ones leads to a positive experience at ECU, so it is our goal to assist parents in their efforts to gather any information that enables them to help their student succeed. Your support now will have a lasting impact on your student\u2019s college journey.",
